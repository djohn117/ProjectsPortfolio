The selection of a well-diversified portfolio of stocks requires a thoughtful analysis of various factors and consideration of their potential for covariant movement. In this introductory section, I will explain the reasons behind me choosing a set of diverse stocks, namely Apple, Nike, Levi Strauss & Co., Southwest Airlines, Tesla, Sony, Spotify, Bitcoin, and Amazon. I will explore the commonalities among these stocks and the motivation to clump them together to assess their potential for moving in a covariant manner. \n","\n","Apple, Nike, Levi Strauss & Co., and Sony are all established brands with strong market positions in their respective sectors. These companies have built reputations for delivering high-quality products and experiences, often driving customer loyalty and generating consistent revenue streams. The recognition and trust associated with these brands contribute to their potential for long-term growth and stability. Furthermore, these stocks represent diverse industries, including technology, consumer goods, transportation, entertainment, and cryptocurrency. This deliberate diversification across sectors aims to reduce concentration risk and provide exposure to various segments of the global economy. \n","\n","**Why Cluster Commodities, to Study Bitcoin or these other brands?**\n","\n","In conclusion, the selection of Apple, Nike, Levi Strauss & Co., Southwest Airlines, Tesla, Sony, Spotify, Bitcoin, and Amazon in this portfolio is based on their association with renowned global brands, diverse industries, innovation, and disruptive potential. By clumping these stocks together, I aim to explore the potential for covariant movement, reducing risk through diversification, and capturing growth opportunities. I myslef have a portfolio of some of these stocks but not all. I own bitcoin, apple, spotify, and Tesla with plans to expand into more of these brands based off of this assignment. Using some of the stocks I owned was a good idea to me since I could learn more about them apart from what I already know."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"803361df-9af3-49bb-ac6c-488996cd5988","metadata":{"id":"803361df-9af3-49bb-ac6c-488996cd5988"},"source":["**Using Cluster Matrices to Study Covariant, Affine Price Behaviors between Bitcoin and Other Commodity Flows**\n","\n","This study samples the recent price behavior of 37 commodities, then traces the covariant, linear behavior, matrix style.
